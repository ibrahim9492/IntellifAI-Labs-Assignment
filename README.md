# 🔧 Code Optimization Task - ML Role at IntellifAI Labs

## 📌 Objective

The purpose of this task is to **optimize the codebase of the LivePortrait GitHub repository** to improve model **inference time**, with optional improvements in **output quality** and **GPU memory usage**.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository (or Colab notebook) includes:

- ✅ **Original Implementation**  
- ⚡ **Optimized Implementation**  
- 📊 **Performance Comparison Report**  
- 💡 **Future Optimization Ideas**

---

## 🔗 Reference Repository

This task is based on the [LivePortrait GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ibrahim9492/IntellifAI-Labs-Assignment.git) (replace with actual repo link if known).

## 🚀 Execution

The notebook includes two main sections:

### 1. **Original Implementation**
- Loaded and ran the unmodified original code.
- Measured:
  - ⏱ Inference Time
  - 🖼 Output Results
  - 📉 GPU Memory Utilization (if applicable)

### 2. **Optimized Implementation**
- Applied various optimizations such as:
  - Model quantization or TorchScript conversion
  - Replacing inefficient layers/operations
  - Reducing input size with negligible impact on quality
  - Efficient data preprocessing and batching
- Measured and compared:
  - ⏱ Reduced Inference Time
  - 📉 Lower Memory Usage
  - 🖼 Maintained or improved Output Quality
